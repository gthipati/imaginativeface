            <h3><span class="deco">Just call me Gen.</span></h3>
              <p>Statistically, I'm an Asian (Taiwanese-Thai) American female residing in
                San Diego. I'm currently an Engagement Assistant at Geisel Library, the main
                library of my alma mater, UC San Diego. My skill repertoire includes Adobe 
                Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere Pro, and a bit of HTML&CSS.
              <br><br>More personally, I'm an illustrator fluent in paper-n-pen doodles
              and digital art. I love creating characters, and building stories and worlds 
              for them to play in. Much of inspiration stems from fiction novels (text and graphic) 
              and animated films. Traveling is a more recent fascination of mine and I hope to 
              continue adventuring through new places.</p>

                      <br>
                <p>For my Media 101 class, our group of 3 recorded and edited a
                  two-minute layered sound piece about a suspenseful chase
                  between the main character and a stalker. This project has no
                  video and only uses original sounds produced by us. The point
                  of this project was to practice creating sounds, including
                  ambient, by using every day items. </p>
                  <h3><span class="deco">Concept</h3>
                  <img src="img/Sound Proj Cover.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                    <p>The assignment required us to put together sounds to tell
                      a story of a journey of our choice. The aspects of this
                      assignment include brainstorming, storyboarding, capturing
                      sound with various types of recording equipment, and
                      editing using Adobe Premiere. My role in this project was mainly pre-production (storyboarding)
                      and post-production (editing).
                      <br><br>
                      Since our first video Project was mystery themed, we
                      decided to continue with darker themes in this project.
                      After we decided that the story would include only two
                      characters: the stalker and the victim, we brainstormed an
                      outline for the story. Our first problem was deciding how
                      the listener would distinguish the two characters since
                      there wasn’t going to be any dialogue. The most logical
                      option was to go with the sound of the characters’
                      footsteps, which depending on the shoes they wore.
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/Sound Proj Chara.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                    <p>Our initial decision was to have the victim be a woman
                      wearing some type of heeled shoe while the stalker was a
                      male wearing sneakers. After discussing it with our TA, we
                      decided to that it would be more interesting if we flipped
                      the genders from what most people would expect in a
                      stalker/victim scenario. Therefore, the victim became a
                      younger male and the stalker was a woman wearing thick
                      heeled shoes.</p>
                      <h3><span class="deco">On-Site Recording</h3>
                      <p>Since majority of the piece needed to be filmed outdoors
                        to gather accurate sounds of footsteps on various terrains
                        (concrete, steel stairs) and the sound of still outdoor
                        air, we chose our shooting location based on how populated
                        the filming area would be. We needed a lot of specific
                        sounds and couldn’t have the interference of random,
                        unneeded noises. That said, we still encountered a few
                        instances where it was still too difficult to gather a
                        specific sound. For example, we wanted the buzz off a street
                        light but the constant airplane engines and strong wind
                        prevented us from getting the sound we wanted. Eventually,
                        we used a generator that gave off a similar hum and lowered
                        the intensity of the sound when we got to the editing room.</p>

                        <h3><span class="deco">Editing</h3>
                          <p>We used Adobe Premiere to edit our project as that
                            was the program being taught. My job was to quality
                            check our sounds files, which was important because
                            we wanted minimal outside noise in each individual
                            sound. After, I would do a rough cut where I layered
                            the sounds and sequenced them approximately to match
                            our storyboard. That way, my group could determine
                            whether we needed to record additional sounds to
                            make the story sound more realistic or re-record
                            corrupted sounds.</p>

                <p>I interned as a graphic designer for The Zone at UC San
                  Diego. The Zone is a wellness lounge for students and hosts
                  various free programs promoting a healthy life and well-being.

                <p>Designing for The Zone requires us to be mindful about how our
                designs market the space. We want to promote an open, inclusive
                space where students can relax, lift their mood, and learn ways
                to lead a healthier lifestyle. Some of my work this quarter
                includes re-designing two, 11inx17in posters that market specific
                programs that The Zone offers.

                <h3><span class="deco">Body Composition</h3>
                  <p>Students can come in for a free analysis of their body
                    weight, blood pressure, water content, and body fat percentage.
                    We didn’t want the poster to include images of weights, scales,
                    and body types as those images could be triggering to certain
                    individuals. The Zone also seeks to promote overall health,
                    not specific body types or specific definitions of what
                    “health” means. This is also the first piece I’ve ever designed
                    completely on Adobe Illustrator. </p>

                <h3><span class="deco">Meditation</h3>
                  <p>This program encourages students to take a step back from
                    their hectic college life and focus on their breath. I wanted
                    the poster convey a sense of peacefulness and calm. The text
                    about the program was created in collaboration with the
                    instructor that leads the weekly meditation sessions.</p>

                    our 10-week quarter as well as finals week, the calendar
                    lists the time and name of programs that are offered this
                    week. I was given creative freedom with the design of the
                    calendar. I change up the colors and graphics depending on
                    the season and/or program. Here are some of them.</p>

                     graphics and layouts in collaboration with the page editors. Based on the stories, 
                     the editors would request particular graphics to accompany the stories.</p>

                    <p>I also designed the graphic for the t-shirt that year. The design was vote for by 
                    the staff out of the designs created by the other graphic artists. The concept of 
                    my design was based on the idea that a newspaper was a form of creative writing and 
                    I wanted our design to suit that freedom. I also wanted to incorporate our high 
                    school's mascot, The Moor, but draw him more lighthearted than the tough image he 
                    usually depicts. </p>

                    <p>While graphic designers were not in charge of page layouts, our advisor tasked 
                    the graphic designers to brainstorm new layout styles one time. We were provided a 
                    few mock opinions stories for us to design an opinions page. I don't often work in 
                    InDesign but I wanted to create a layout using the program that our page editors used 
                    even though we were given permision to use Photoshop. This was my layout pitch.</p>

                <p>I was Art Chair for 2 years in Kaibigan Service Club at Alhambra High School.

                  patches. Here is the design chosen by popular for for the 2013-14 club attire. 
                    Our club's mascot is a friendly alien and the theme of our designs traditionally 
                    revolved around outerspace. My design showcases the cutie in a spaceship along 
                    with moons and stars. Since our budget didn't allow us to print the galaxy, I 
                    thought using negatives would be appropriate for our black jacket.</p>

                <p>This is a collaboration I did with the <a href="https://www.facecheck.gg/">Facecheck</a> 
                  to design a logo for their website. The site is an informational League
                  of Legends website created as part of an official contest. 
                  <br>
                  The term "facecheck" is defined officially as " A bad practice in League of 
                  Legends in which a player checks what's in a brush by entering it instead of 
                  placing a ward or using a skillshot to create vision from distance." Basically,
                   to stick one's face in a bush. The website's purpose is to provide useful 
                  gameplay information for players and also have interactice forums. The idea 
                  for the logo is based on the concept of a bush. Early iterations of the logo 
                  were quite literal to the term "facecheck".</p>

                  <img src="img/logo-01.png" class="img-responsive">
                  <p>However, we decided to scrap those ideas as the cuteness of the logo did not
                     suit the image of their site, which is informational and more professional. Thus,
                     I played with the idea of using bush leaves to form the letter 'F', which was a 
                    concept well-received by the team. I continued to flesh out the idea and eventually 
                    created a loading animation of the logo for them to use on their website as well.</p>

                <p>For my senior project in Communication, I collaborated with a peer, Sunjae Lee, to create 
                  an updated promotional video for The Zone, a student wellness center on UCSD 
                  campus. Under the supervision of Professor Brian Goldfarb and the help of The 
                  Zone supervisor and interns, we brainstormed a concept for the video that highlighted 
                  the programs and resources offered by The Zone to the student body. The video was filmed 
                  and edited within the 10 weeks of the quarter by both Sunjae and I. It was also a chance to 
                  gain experience creating title animations and motion graphics in Adobe After Effects.</p>
